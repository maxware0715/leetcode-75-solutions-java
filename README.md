## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/teamlead/leetcode-75-solutions-java.git
```

2. Navigate to a specific problem:

```bash
cd src/category_name
```

3. Compile and run the Java solution:

```bash
javac ProblemName.java
java -ea ProblemName
```

If using IDEA, right-click the src folder, then select "Mark Directory" as "Sources Root". Now, Java files should benefit from all the Java IDE features of IntelliJ IDEA, including autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and more.

Remember, when using assertions in Java, ensure that you've enabled them by using the `-ea` flag when running the Java program.
